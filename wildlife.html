	<h1> A wildlife sanctuary</h1>
	<p> The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 is a landmark Indian law enacted to provide protection and conservation for wild animals, birds, and plants, as well as for matters connected to them. Key objectives include prohibiting hunting, poaching, and trading of endangered species, establishing penalties for these violations, and creating designated protected areas like National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries to preserve habitats and prevent wildlife exploitation. </p>

		<u> Nearly extinct animals like the Amur leopard, Javan and Sumatran rhinos, Mountain Gorillas, <i>Black Rhinos, Sunda Island Tiger, and Lion-Tailed Macaque </i>are protected in wildlife sanctuaries, which serve as critical havens to prevent their complete extinction by offering habitat protection and prohibiting hunting. For example, the Amur leopard is critically endangered in parts of Russia and China, while Indian sanctuaries protect rhinos and the Lion-Tailed Macaque </u> </dd>
