My Favorite things</h1>
	<p style="color:rgb(6, 29, 79);"> My Favorite hobbies include creative writing, painting, pencil drawing and other artistic creations.
	I liked to study fashion designing too. I have done several embroydary work by my own, without any training.
	I like coding ,but doesnt tried it sice I havent any knowledge in it.
	I like to engage my career in technical field that requires creative skills.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(6, 29, 79);"> I would love to have the freedom to work on my art all the time and let someone else take care of all the rest. And I’m also realistic enough to know that won’t happen. The best I can do is to stay focused on producing work and finding ways to share it with the world. So if you like my work, keep checking back and sharing my web site with your friends. I’ll probably be in the studio working on a painting, outside carving a piece of stone, or here on the computer, writing a blog with photos of new art for you to look at.</p>
